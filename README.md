ToDo:
* Front End (Make it pretty! Animations!)
    -> In progress!
* Auth
* Check if song name + artist is in DB already
* Check if YT link is valid + serialize it to be the ID only
    * Feature where we'll search for a valid YT video for them
* Add users when adding song, and then allowing upvotes and such. 
* Update YT Link
* No duplicate tags
* Community Notes (How they used it in a game)
* Search By Tag (Maybe we can do something where we pull all tags, and the AI can suggest a few tags based on what the user wrote?)
    * AI suggested tags for a song 
* Copy link
